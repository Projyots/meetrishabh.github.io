  <p>Its very simple and it requires minimum effort from your end. It includes following steps:</p>
  <hr>

  <ul class="grid">
    <li>
      <i class="fa fa-compass fa-4x"></i>
      <h4>Requirement Gathering</h4>
      <p>When you place an order, we ask you a few questions in order to understand your requirements, your target
        audience, your goals, your competitors, and any other detail that we may need to customize your website.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-4x"></i>
      <h4>Website Prototype</h4>
      <p>By combining the details provided by you with our own industry and keyword research, we create a website
        wireframe and send it to you for approval.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i class="fa fa-bicycle fa-4x"></i>
      <h4>First Mockup</h4>
      <p>Once you approve the website’s blueprint, we start creating the visuals – images, videos, charts, or
        graphs. The layout of the website is created keeping in mind your products or services, core brand values,
        industry, target audience and competitors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i class="fa fa-flag-checkered fa-4x"></i>
      <h4>Performance Check</h4>
      <p>After the web development testing, we run a website performance check to measure its speed and to check
        how it’s responding to end-user interactions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i class="fa fa-flag-checkered fa-4x"></i>
      <h4>Going Live</h4>
      <p>After comprehensive performance and optimization tests, we launch the website. Even after the website is
        live, we monitor it for a few days to make sure that it is running smoothly.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="quote">Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love being outside with my friends. After going on one of these tours, I can safely say that beer pong is my favorite game all time, also the cultural programs were really interesting!</p>
  <p class="author">- Albert Herter</p>
  <p class="quote">Wow, this really blew my mind. We had so much fun at the beach, and also some hidden secrets revealed. Come on, I'm living in this city for 5 years. Amazing!</p>
  <p class="author">- Sharon Rosenberg</p>
  <p class="quote">If you want to understand your friends better, head to the mountains. I mean, seriously. It's like sitting next to a campfire and just talk in the sunset, woah. You know? It's like that.</p>
